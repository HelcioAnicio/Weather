## Overview

### The challenge

The users should be able to:

- Search a lot of citys in the world
- See the weather temperature of the searched city
- Also see the feature of each weather temperature
- The background interactive according to weather temperature
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SASS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Conditional
- API
- Async and Await
- Ternary conditional
- Events

### What I learned

Om this project I practiced my skill of work with API query. I used getWeather and async, await.
I also used conditionals what each weather temperature the background behaved differently.

```JS
const showWeather = async (citySearch) => {
  const data = await getWeather(citySearch);
  console.log(data);
  informations.style.display = "flex";
  fieldSearch.value = "";

  city.innerHTML = data.name;
  country.innerHTML = ` -${data.sys.country}`;
  deg.innerHTML = `${parseInt(data.main.temp)}Â°C`;
  weather.innerHTML =
    data.weather[0].description[0].toUpperCase() +
    data.weather[0].description.substring(1);
  imageCondition.setAttribute(
    "src",
    `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${data.weather[0].icon}.png`
  );
  background();
};
```

### Continued development

I want to query one API bigger than i used, and i'll do a project better and more beautiful.

### Useful resources

This resource helped me a lot to understand how to do to implemented JS.
