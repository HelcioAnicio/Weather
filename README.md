## Overview
<!-- ### The challenge
The users should be able to:
- To see the time now.
- To see hour, minute and second.
- The second updates every second.
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- SASS (variabels, scops)
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Conditional
- Object orientation
- Constructor
- Ternary conditional
<!-- 

### What I learned
I worked with constructor, and i used to show the hour at moment exactly.
```JS
function time() {
    let date = new Date();
    let hours = date.getHours();
    let minutes = date.getMinutes();
    let seconds = date.getSeconds();
    
    hours < 10 ? hour.innerHTML = `0${hours}` : hour.innerHTML = hours
    minutes < 10 ? minute.innerHTML = `0${minutes}` : minute.innerHTML = minutes
    seconds < 10 ? second.innerHTML = `0${seconds}` : second.innerHTML = seconds

    setTimeout('time()', 500);
}
```

### Continued development
I will developer my projets using OOP to better knowledge and practice. -->
